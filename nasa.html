	<div class="background"><h1>What Is NASA?</h1>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is an independent agency of the United States Federal Government responsible for the 
civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research. NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for eronautics (NACA).
The new agency was to have a distinctly civilian orientation, encouraging peaceful applications in space science. Since its establishment, 
most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space 
Shuttle. NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch 
System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program which provides oversight of launch operations and 
countdown management for unmanned NASA launches.NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System; advancing 
heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program; exploring bodies throughout the Solar System 
with advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as New Horizons; and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great 
Observatories and associated programs.</p></div>

<p>The Mercury 13 were thirteen American women who, as part of a privately funded program, underwent the same physiological screening tests as the astronauts selected by NASA on April 9, 1959 for Project Mercury. The term was coined in 1959 by Hollywood producer James Cross as a comparison to the Mercury Seven name given to the selected male astronauts; however, the Mercury 13 were not part of NASA's astronaut program, never flew in space and never met as a group. </p>
